# Assignment for module one (HTML and CSS)

You are to turn the high fidelity screen shots into html and css code (found in the assets folder)

Begin by looking at these screen shots. Then find images for:
two blogs (the home and blog pages)
yourself (the about page)
favicon (the website browser tab image)

If you would like to write the blog content itself, that is fine, however lorem ipsum is also fine (placeholder text)

The task is to make a fully responsive multiple page website using only html and css.

There will be three main pages:
The home page,
the about page,
and the blog page.
Additionally, the blog page has a duplicatible version where the content is replaced with relevant material (build one blog page and then just duplicate that file and rename it to another blog page, i.e, blog-one, blog-two, etc.)

Once you have done with the markup and styling, create your own repository on github and upload your folder. Send me the link to this folder once you have finished with the exercise.

I have deliberately left the instructions brief and to the point. Part of this task is to enjoy approaching the build with what you have learned so far. I will have available more instructive details if requested.

My advice is to start with a piece of paper and sketch out the wireframe and family tree structures before touching any code. When you start marking up, use colored boxes to organise the layout before worrying about any of the children elements, i.e, create the header, main area and footer first, then go from there. Goodluck.
